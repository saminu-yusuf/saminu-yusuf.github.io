        <h3>Project 2: Carelocator</h3>
        <p>     We, the team behind CareLocator, are proud to have made significant progress on this important project. After going through all the critical stages of planning, ideation, and design, we are now ready to move into the development phase. This journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and we're confident that our solution will address the problem of doctor availability in hospitals during emergencies.

Our team consists of three dedicated members, all students of the 3MTT program:

    Myself, as the Product Manager, have guided the project from its initial concept, ensuring the vision and objectives remained clear.
    A. Haruna, our UI/UX Designer, has created a sleek and intuitive interface, making the app user-friendly for both patients and healthcare professionals.
    A. Lawan, our Data Scientist, has been crucial in developing the data infrastructure and algorithms that track real-time doctor availability and optimize the response times in emergencies.

Together, we've laid the foundation for CareLocator, and now, with development as our final stage, we are ready to bring this solution to life and make a positive impact in healthcare accessibility.
