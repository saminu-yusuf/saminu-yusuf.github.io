    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As teachers, we know that compiling and generating report cards each term can be a time-consuming, manual process. From gathering all CA booklets across subjects to tallying first, second, and third CAs and final exams, teachers invest hours that could be better spent focusing on teaching and student engagement. The <strong>Report Card Generator</strong> app is here to transform this process.</p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>Problem</h2>
    <p>1. <strong>Time-Consuming Manual Work:</strong> Teachers often spend a large amount of time collecting, calculating, and entering CA and exam scores across various subjects.<br>
       2. <strong>Human Error in Calculations:</strong> Manually summing up multiple assessment scores can lead to mistakes, resulting in inaccurate final grades.<br>
       3. <strong>Lack of Efficiency:</strong> With so many subjects and steps involved, the traditional method delays report generation, leaving teachers with limited time for other responsibilities.</p>

       2. <strong>Reducing Errors:</strong> The appâ€™s built-in calculations eliminate common mistakes made during manual entry, ensuring accurate grades.<br>
       3. <strong>Streamlined Process:</strong> All subjects and scores are handled in one platform, making it easy to generate report cards quickly and efficiently.</p>
